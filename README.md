# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model using **Keras Sequential API** to classify brain MRI images into two categories:

- `0`: Normal (No tumor)
- `1`: Diseased (Tumor present)

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of brain MRI images pre-labeled as either normal or tumorous. Images are preprocessed for input into a convolutional neural network.

> 📌 *Ensure your dataset is organized into two folders within a `train/` and `test/` directory, e.g.:*
